# Coding Challenges

🏆 This is where programming practice is done by completing challenges!

🐍 I have used Python, but feel free to use whichever Programming Language you like.

📁 The description of each challenge can be found within their respective folders.

🤔 Along with the description, comes my version of the solution. At least I THINK they are the solutions.

😅 Not all of the challenges have solutions. As of now, there is only one incomplete challenge.

🤞 Promise I'll do it later.

## List of challenges

* String Challenge
* Array Challenge
* Chart Challenge
* FizzBuzz Challenge

It's not much yet, but more are on the way. Have fun breaking your heads! Cheers 🍻
